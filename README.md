# Potato_leaf_disease
## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting diseases in potato leaves using Deep Learning. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on images of healthy and diseased potato leaves to classify them into respective categories.

Clone the Repository
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Potato_Leaf_Disease_Detection.git
cd Potato_Leaf_Disease_Detection
```

## Features
* Classifies potato leaves as Healthy or Diseased
* Uses CNN-based Deep Learning Model
* Flask Web Interface for easy image upload & classification
* User-friendly Interface with visualization

## Model Training
* Dataset: Contains images of healthy and diseased potato leaves.
* Model: CNN architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras.
* Augmentation: Applied image transformations to improve model performance.
* Evaluation: Model tested with accuracy and loss metrics.
## Future Improvements
* Improve model accuracy with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet)
* Deploy model using Flask + Docker or FastAPI
* Build a mobile app for real-time disease detection
